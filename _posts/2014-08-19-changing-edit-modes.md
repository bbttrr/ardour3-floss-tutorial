We have already learned a bit about the Select/Move and Range tools. In
this chapter we will get an overview of all the **Edit Modes** and
**Cursor Modes** available on that part of the Editor Window.

## Edit Modes and Cursor Modes

![Ardour Edit Modes](../images/Ardour3_Edit_Modes_Cursor_Modes.png)

These controls define the behavior of the main canvas and the different
functions of the cursor.

The drop-down **Edit Mode** menu contains three options. **Slide Edit**
is the standard mode, and the one we will be using in this tutorial. It
allows you to freely drag regions around horizontally (within the same
track) and vertically (between tracks). The other two options limit or
block your ability to move regions from their positions, but we will not
cover them in detail here.

### Select/Move Object (shortcut "*O*")

![O](../images/Ardour3_EditModes_O.png)

This Cursor Mode allows you to select or move objects such as regions
and breakpoints (in an automation curve). When this Cursor Mode is
selected, your cursor pointer will look like a little hand icon.

### Range (shortcut "*R*")

![R](../images/Ardour3_EditModes_R.png)

This Cursor Mode allows you to click and drag to define or resize
Ranges.Â  When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor pointer will
look like a vertical line.

### Zoom Range (shortcut "*Z*")

![Z](../images/Ardour3_EditModes_Z.png)

This Cursor Mode provides a box which can be dragged around an area of
the Main Canvas. When the mouse is released, the view of the Canvas will
Zoom to that selection. When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor
pointer will have the shape of a magnifying glass.

> TIP: Note: there are other ways of zooming in and out. A handy shortcut is
to use the "plus" and "minus" keys of your computer keyboard. Zooming
will happen in relation to the Edit Point currently chosen (Mouse,
Marker, or Playhead).

### **Draw Gain Automation** (shortcut *"G"*)

![G](../images/Ardour3_EditModes_G.png)

Use this Cursor Mode if you want to draw Region-specific volume
**Automation**. The automation curve created this way will stick to the
region on which it was created, even when the Region is moved around.
This type of gain Automation is drawn directly on the Region itself,
which makes it different from the Automation used in the drop-down
Automation region (see chapter on **Automation**). When this Cursor Mode
is selected, your cursor pointer will look like a cross.

Drawing Region-specific Gain Automation looks like this:

### **Stretch/Shrink Region** (shortcut *"T"*)

![T](../images/Ardour3_EditModes_T.png)

This Cursor Mode allows you to drag and resize the duration of an entire
Region without changing the Pitch. This is sometimes called 'Time
stretching', hence the shortcut **"T"**. Please see the chapter on
**Stretching/Shrinking Regions** for more details. When this Cursor Mode
is selected, your cursor pointer will look like a diagonal arrow.

### **Listen to Specific Regions**

![Audition](../images/Ardour3_EditModes_Audition.png)

This Cursor Mode allows you to click on any existing Region on any track
and have it immediately played back. Playback stops at the end of the
Region. When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor pointer will look
like a small loudspeaker icon.

> TIP: quickly audition a selected Region with the shortcut "*H*".

### MIDI Cursor Modes

The last two buttons you see after the **Listen to Specific Regions**
button are related to MIDI operations, and will not be covered in this
manual.

## Continuing

In the following chapter, we will see how to take the Regions we have
edited and **Creating Looped Sections** from them.
