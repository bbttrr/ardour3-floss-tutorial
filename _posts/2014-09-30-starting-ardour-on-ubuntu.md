Now that JACK and Ardour are installed, and JACK has been successfully
started, you can start up Ardour.

On Ubuntu, you can find and launch software using the Dash. Tap the
*"Super"* key (or *"Super" + "A"* to go directly to the Dash App Lens)
and type Ardour. You can then click on the Ardour icon, or simply hit
*Enter* when Ardour is the first search result:

Click on **Ardour Digital Audio Workstation 3** and the program will
start.

Alternatively, you can run Ardour from the commandline by entering

    ardour3 &

in a terminal.

Once you have started Ardour, the **Session Control**window shows up.
You can click on **New Session** to create a brand new session, or you
can open an existing session using the **Recent Sessions** and **Other
Sessions** options. For now let's create a fresh session, so click on
**New Session**. The window should now look like the screenshot below.
Name your new project and click on **Open** .
