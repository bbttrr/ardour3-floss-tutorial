Exporting Regions
=================

**Exporting** is the process of saving a Region, Track or Session to a
file on your computer. You may wish to Export only a Region of your
Session, perhaps to use as a sample in another application, or to Edit
it in a different editor program.

Export a Region \
-----------------

To Export a Region, select it (so it becomes blue), and then right-click
**Export** or use the top menu: *Session \> Export \> Export selected
regions to audiofile*.

This will open up a dialogue box with several options. You'll usually
Export as an **AIFF** or **WAV** file, at either **16-bit** or
**24-bit**. 16-bit files can be burnt directly to an audio CD, but if
you intend the audio to be further processed, it is best to export it at
24-bit. Having chosen your options, enter the track name at the top and
select *Export*.

*Warning: overwriting existing files causes Ardour to become confused,
resulting in empty files being Exported. Be sure to use a unique file
name each time you Export!* \

Please note that when exporting a Region, not all parameters and edits
are Exported. **Trimmed**, **split**, **stretched** and **reversed**
regions can be Exported, but edits such as **Normalizing**, **Fading**
and **Panning**, and **Automation** are *not* Exported. Also, the volume
of the audio Track itself or the Master Bus will not affect the Exported
file. To Export these edits, please see the chapters on **Exporting a
Range** and **Exporting a Session**.

In the next chapter, we will learn about **Exporting Ranges** rather
than just an individual Region. \
