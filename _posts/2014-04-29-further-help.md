Besides the URLs listed in the Links chapter, there are a couple of
resources on the Internet to help you learn Ardour and fix some of the
problems that you might have along the way.

## Ardour Manual

The official Ardour Manual is the main reference to Ardour. It is a work in progress, meaning you will not find every single feature explained there (yet). But it is already an amazing resource:

## Getting Help via Chat

A good way to get support when learning Ardour and working with it is
using the **Chat** function. Ardour has a built in "Chat" option, found
in the Main Menu under *Help > Chat* to connect (via your web browser)
to the Ardour [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) channel at
Freenode.

You could also use your IRC capable chat application (like Pidgin or
Xchat) to connect to the Ardour channel (\#ardour or \#ardour-osx) at
the Freenode network, or use this weblink directly:

[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ardour](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ardour)

Enter a nickname and connect, you are welcome!

In such a IRC Chat channel or room, you find the Ardour developers and
other users to chat about using Ardour, problems and/or bugs you are
facing, or about suggestions for Ardour which you want to discuss.

## Getting Help via Mailing Lists

For those that prefer mailing lists to IRC chatting, the Ardour Users
mailing list is also a good place where users and some developers
discuss all kinds of problems and ideas related to using Ardour. This is
an active list, with many helpful and knowledgeable users around to help
guide less experienced people. There are sometimes more general
discussions about topics like recording technique, audio interface
selection, etc.
